# Architecture_Implementation

## Goal

Implement DL & ML models from their paper . Understanding the reason why they were made (the advantage they had on their peers),
implement them on various datasets ( same for each fields ) to compare it with what was previously done.

# Implemented

:white_check_mark: ResNet </br>
:white_check_mark: EfficientNet </br>
:white_check_mark: UNET </br>

# To DO

# Architecture_Implementation

## Goal

Implement DL & ML models from their paper . Understanding the reason why they were made (the advantage they had on their peers),
implement them on various datasets ( same for each fields ) to compare it with what was previously done.

My Learning process to understand a new model is :</br>
    1. Reading vulgarization on the model (no math involved at this step), only the general idea.</br>
    2. Look at some video on the model.</br>
    3. Go more in depth on step 1&2.</br>
    4. Read the original paper.</br>
    5. Implement it from scratch.</br>
    6. If possible find the same result as described in the paper.</br>

## Implemented

:white_check_mark: ResNet </br>
:white_check_mark: UNET </br>
:white_check_mark: VAE </br>
:white_check_mark: RNN </br>
:white_check_mark: Transformer </br>
:white_check_mark: Res-UNet-a </br>

## To implement

## Comments 

This repository was only done in order for me to understand the various deep learning architecture. It may contains mistakes and in this case do not hesitate to contact me as I would be happy to correct them and further my understanding.

## To do 

Adapt each folder to format : </br>
    - implementation</br>
    - examples </br> 
    README.md </br>

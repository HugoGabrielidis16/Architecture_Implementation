# Architecture_Implementation

## Goal

Implement DL & ML models from their paper . Understanding the reason why they were made (the advantage they had on their peers),
implement them on various datasets ( same for each fields ) to compare it with what was previously done.

My Learning process to understand a new model is :
    1. Reading vulgarization on the model (no math involved at this step), only the general idea.
    2. Look at some video on the model.
    3. Go more in depth on step 1&2.
    4. Read the original paper.
    5. Implement it from scratch.
    6. If possible find the same result as described in the paper.

# GANs

# Generator

Generator produces fakes data and tries to trick the Discriminator

# Discriminator

Discriminator inspects the fake data and determines if it's real or not

# Tips

Generator and Discriminator are randomly initalized at the beginning, and are trained simultaneously -> Minimize 2 loss
-> Use BCE Loss

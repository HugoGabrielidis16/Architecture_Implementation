Different type of RNN : 
    - One to One -> One input / One cell / One output
    - One to Many -> One input / Several cell / Several output (n_cell = n_output)
    - Many to One -> Several input / Several cell / One output (n_cell = n_input)
    - Many to Many v1 (n_output = n_input) -> Several input / Several cell / Several output (n_cell = n_input = n_output)
    - Many to Many v1 (n_output = n_input) -> Several input / Several cell / Several output (n_cell = n_input + n_output - 1)
